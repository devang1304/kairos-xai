### Current Limitations in Feature Correlations
- **High dimensionality**: Large datasets with many features lead to excessive computational requirements, making it challenging to handle malware detection efficiently.
- **Spurious correlations**: Malware detection systems often struggle with non-linear and irrelevant feature correlations that can mimic malicious behavior, resulting in misclassifications.
- **Overfitting and lack of generalization**: Some deep learning models may overly rely on certain correlations, which work well on training data but fail to generalize to new malware variants.
- **Lack of interpretability**: Especially in deep learning models, understanding why certain features correlate with malicious behavior remains a challenge, limiting the trustworthiness of predictions.

### How Limitations in Feature Correlations Affect Security Decisions
- **False positives**: Misleading correlations can result in benign activities being flagged as malicious, overwhelming security teams with unnecessary alerts.
- **False negatives**: Important malware can be overlooked due to weak or missing feature correlations, leaving systems vulnerable to attacks.
- **Decreased trust in AI models**: Without clear interpretability and explainability of how features drive decisions, cybersecurity teams may not fully trust the outcomes of malware detection models.
- **Operational inefficiency**: High false positive rates can lead to alert fatigue, making it difficult for teams to focus on real threats.

### Research Question
Based on these gaps, a potential research question could be:

*"How can Explainable AI (XAI) improve feature correlation methods to reduce false positives and negatives in dynamic malware detection systems?"*

### Implications of Ignoring These Limitations
- **Missed threats**: Ignoring spurious or weak correlations can lead to undetected malware, especially in cases where malicious behavior mimics benign activities.
- **Alert fatigue**: High false positive rates from unreliable correlations overwhelm security teams, reducing their ability to respond to real threats efficiently.
- **Vulnerability to advanced malware**: Adversaries may exploit flaws in feature correlation, making systems susceptible to zero-day attacks or evasion techniques.
- **Lack of actionable insights**: Without addressing these limitations, models remain opaque, and security teams may be unable to act on alerts due to poor interpretability and confidence in decisions.
