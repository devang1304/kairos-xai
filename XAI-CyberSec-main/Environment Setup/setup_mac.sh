"""
While PyTorch with the MPS backend can leverage Apple's GPU (M1/M2) for acceleration, 
PyTorch Geometric (PyG) operations may not fully utilize GPU acceleration at this time, 
as MPS support is still evolving and PyG's heavy reliance on custom CUDA kernels means 
some operations are not fully accelerated yet on Metal.

You can use MPS on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) for GPU acceleration in PyTorch, 
but full support for PyTorch Geometric on MPS is limited. 
However, it will still work, running on a mix of CPU and GPU where applicable.
